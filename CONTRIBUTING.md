## Making Changes
If you don't know where to start, the issues tab is a good place to start. Start a conversation in the comments
 section of the issue and we all can discuss on how to solve the issue. As said in the beginning, make sure you
  discuss any changes you wish to make with the other team members.
  
### Creating a Branch
It is a good idea to create a new branch when making changes. You can do this via:
```shell
$ git checkout -b <branch-name>
```
Make sure you branch name gives a short, but descriptive idea of the change.

You can push changes to the branch you created via the following process:
```shell
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Describe the change you made"
$ git push -u origin <branch-name>
```

## Pull Request Process
1. Before submitting a PR, please ensure that all tests pass. If a test fails, please review and fix your code so the
 test passes.
2. When submitting a PR, please leave a detailed description of the change(s) you made.
3. Please request at least one team member to review your PR.

## Getting Stuck?
Don't be afraid to ask for help! It's better to have two sets of eyes on the problem instead of having to drag
 yourself through the mud to fix an error. If you have questions, reach out to someone and have a discussion. We want
  to ensure that everyone has a hand in the project and helping others can make the project that much more successful.
